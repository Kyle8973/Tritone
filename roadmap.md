### Phase 1: Performance & UX

-   **Gapless Playback**: Preloading The Next Track Into A Secondary Buffer To Eliminate Silence Between Songs.
    
-   **Infinite Library Scroll**: Moving Beyond The Current Album Limits By Implementing An `offset` Loading System.
    
-   **Image Lazy-Loading**: Bandwidth Optimization To Only Load Artwork When It Enters The Viewport.

### Phase 2: Power User Tools

-   **10-Band Equalizer**: Native Audio Processing For Custom Sound Profiles.
    
-   **Mini-Player Mode**: A Compact "Always On Top" View Focusing On Essential Controls And Artwork.

### Phase 3: Platform Expansion
